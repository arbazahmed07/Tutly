## Documentation Structure

Tutly's documentation is organized into logical sections to help users find information quickly.

## Navigation Syntax

The navigation menu is defined in `docs.json`. Here's how to structure it:

<CodeGroup>

```json Basic Structure
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Guides",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": ["introduction", "quickstart"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

```json Advanced Structure
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "Guides",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Getting Started",
          "pages": [
            "introduction",
            "quickstart",
            {
              "group": "Core Features",
              "pages": [
                "features/live-classes",
                "features/assignments"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Recommended Structure

For Tutly documentation, we recommend organizing content as follows:

1. **Getting Started**

   - Introduction
   - Quickstart
   - Development Setup

2. **Core Features**

   - Live Classes
   - Assignments
   - Portfolios
   - Events
   - Analytics

3. **API Reference**

   - Authentication
   - Endpoints
   - Webhooks

4. **Guides**
   - Best Practices
   - Troubleshooting
   - Security

## File Organization

- Keep related content in the same directory
- Use clear, descriptive filenames
- Follow a consistent naming convention
- Group feature-specific documentation in feature folders

<Warning>
  Avoid using `api` as a top-level folder name. Use `api-reference` instead.
</Warning>

## Hidden Pages

Pages not included in `docs.json` won't appear in the navigation but can still be accessed via direct links or search.
