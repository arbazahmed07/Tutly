## Why Use Reusable Content?

Reusable content helps maintain consistency across Tutly's documentation and makes updates easier. Common use cases include:

- Feature descriptions
- Setup instructions
- Code examples
- Configuration templates
- Common warnings or notes

## Creating Reusable Content

### Basic Snippet

1. Create your snippet in the `snippets` directory:

```mdx snippets/feature-intro.mdx
# Live Classes

Tutly's built-in live class system provides:

- Unlimited attendees
- Real-time engagement tracking
- Automatic attendance
- Recording capabilities
```

2. Import and use the snippet:

```mdx features/live-classes.mdx
---
title: "Live Classes"
description: "Host interactive live sessions"
---

import FeatureIntro from "/snippets/feature-intro.mdx";

<FeatureIntro />

### Reusable Variables

1. Create a file with shared variables:

```mdx snippets/constants.mdx
export const apiBaseUrl = "https://api.tutly.in/v1";
export const maxFileSize = "5MB";
export const supportedFormats = ["PNG", "JPG", "SVG", "GIF"];

;
```

2. Use the variables in your documentation:

```mdx features/assignments.mdx
---
title: "Assignments"
description: "Create and manage assignments"
---

import { maxFileSize, supportedFormats } from "/snippets/constants.mdx";

## File Upload Guidelines

- Maximum file size: {maxFileSize}
- Supported formats: {supportedFormats.join(', ')}
```

### Reusable Components

1. Create a component for repeated UI elements:

```mdx snippets/feature-card.mdx
export const FeatureCard = ({ title, description, icon }) => (
  <Card title={title} icon={icon}>
    {description}
  </Card>
);

;
```

2. Use the component in your pages:

```mdx features/index.mdx
---
title: "Features"
description: "Tutly platform features"
---

import { FeatureCard } from "/snippets/feature-card.mdx";

<FeatureCard
  title="Live Classes"
  icon="video"
  description="Host interactive sessions with unlimited attendees"
/>

<FeatureCard
  title="Assignments"
  icon="code"
  description="Create test case-based assignments with auto-evaluation"
/>
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep snippets focused and single-purpose
2. Use clear, descriptive names
3. Document any required props or variables
4. Keep the `snippets` directory organized
5. Update all instances when making changes to shared content
