<Info>**Prerequisites**: - Node.js (version specified in .nvmrc) - pnpm</Info>

## Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run Tutly documentation locally:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tutly.git
cd tutly
```

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment

Run the following command to set up your development environment:

```bash
make up
```

This will:

- Copy the example environment file to `.env`
- Install all dependencies
- Set up local Docker services
- Initialize the database schema
- Load initial dummy data

### Step 3: Start Development Server

```bash
make dev
```

The development server will be running at `http://localhost:3000`

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Start the development server
make dev

# Open Prisma Studio for database management
make studio

# Stop all services
make down

# Clean all services, volumes, and .env
make clean

# Re-initialize the project (after cleaning)
make init
```
